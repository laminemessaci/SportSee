### 2.2 Starting the project

- The `docker image build --no-cache -t micro-api .` command will allow you to build your image.
- The `docker container run --name micro-api -p 3000:3000 -dt micro-api yarn` command will allow you to create your Docker container and run your image on port 3000.
- The `docker container stop micro-api` command will allow you to stop your micro-api.
- The `docker container rm micro-api` command will allow you to delete your micro-api container.

### 2.3 Vscode and container remotes

Finally, if you have VsCode, you can easily launch your project in a docker environment.
